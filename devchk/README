This is the devchk TET test suite, also known as LSB-HDR.  It
is used for development environment certification.  This test
suite verifies binary values in specific header files. *NOTE* It
is possible to build a version without TET. 

You may build with the test suite source files that have been checked 
into the source tree.  In most cases, this should work well.  If you 
prefer to use these existing files, go directly to the "BUILD AND 
EXECUTE THE TEST SUITE" section.

If you prefer to create the test suite source files yourself, the 
system you are going to use for testing will require some setup.  
Start with the "CREATE THE TEST SUITE SOURCE FILES" section, then 
build and execute the test suite.



CREATE THE TEST SUITE SOURCE FILES
==================================

   NOTE: See the README file included with each module for installation
         instructions.

1. Install MySQL on the machine.  The latest versions can be found at 
   http://www.mysql.com or http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql.

2. Make sure the MySQL server daemon is running (process name is mysqld).

3. Install the Perl DBI on the machine.  The latest version can be found at
   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/DBI.

4. Install the Data-ShowTable modules on the machine.  The latest version 
   can be found at http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/Data.

5. Install the Msql-Mysql-modules on the machine.  The latest version can be
   found at http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/DBD.

6. Initialize the SQL database:

	Check out /lsb/data/dbdump from SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net).

	Comment out the "DBOPTS=...." line in the makefile.

	Execute "make restore" to load a copy of the database into MySQL.

7. Build the source files:

	cd to the devchk test directory
	# ./Setup



BUILD AND EXECUTE THE TEST SUITE
================================

USING TET
---------

1. Set the environment variable TET_ROOT and make sure the TET bin 
   directory is in your PATH:

	# export TET_ROOT=/home/etet
	# export PATH=$PATH:$TET_ROOT/bin

2. In the devchk directory and execute the following commands:

	# tcc -b
	# tcc -e

3. The log file for the latest execution of the tests will be left
   in the results/0xxxe/ directory where xxx is the highest number
   in the results directory. You can use the vres program
   in the BIN directory to summaries the test results.
 

NOT USING TET
-------------
1. cd to ts/devchk

2. Make hdrchk
   	# make

3. Run the tests
   ./hdrchk
