.SH NAME
lsbappchk \- check LSB conformance of application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsbappchk
[\f-L \fIpathtolib\fR]... [\fIappname\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Measure an application executable's conformance to the Linux Standard
Base (LSB) specification. The object format of the application is
checked, as is the list of shared libraries used by the application,
and the list of functions and global data used by the
application. Warnings are produced for anything that is used, but not
contained in the LSB specification.
.TP
\fB\-L \fIpathtolib\fR
Specify libraries which are part of the application.  This option can
be specified as many times as needed, and will prevent lsbappchk from
complaining about symbols which are provided in those shared
libraries.
.PP
Lsbappchk cannot detect all conformance problems.  In particular, it
is a static test and does not actually run the application.  Lsbappchk
will not find any behaviors which show themselves only at run\-time
(for example, anything involving the File Hierarchy Standard, or
constants and other such items which are found in header files).
