Installation:
	make
	make install (as root) - places liblsbdynchk.so.1 in /usr/lib/
	make clean (if you like)

Usage:
	(from the dynchk directory)
	./lsbdynchk `command'

Problems:

In tests/type_tests.c, the validate* functions are almost all stubs.
Those that aren't explicitly marked (stub) are probably wrong anyway.
I don't know exactly what each validate function should check.  So,
we're just going to make _lots_ and _lots_ of output.
