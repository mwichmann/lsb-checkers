.TP
\fB\-j \fIJOURNAL\fR, \fB--journal\fR=\fIJOURNAL\fR

instead of to the default filename in the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIPREFIX\fR, \fB--prefix\fR=\fIPREFIX\fR

.PP
A journal file is created with a default name of
.BR journal.lsbcmdchk .
It contains a record of the test results in a format that
can be submitted for LSB Certification.
You must have write access to the current working directory
in order to run 
.I lsbcmdchk
successfully, or use the \fB\-j\fR option to
specify an alternate location for the journal. The
journal file can be omitted by the use of the \fB\-n\fP option.
Journal files may be examined with the
.I tjreport
tool, available from the LSB project as part of the
.B lsb-tet3-lite
package.
