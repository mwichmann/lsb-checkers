.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Measure a static archive's suitability for inclusion in an LSB
conforming binary.  Checks if any unresolved external references
are to interfaces which are not part of the LSB specification.
Since some unresolved external references may be intentional,
.I lsbarchk
can be instructed to look at additional libraries for such references.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
Output the program version and LSB version to standard output.
The version and LSB version are always logged to the journal
file irrespective of this option.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB--nojournal\fR
Do not create a journal file.
.TP
\fB\-A
Check the symbols found in all modules.
.TP
\fB\-M \fIMODULE\fR, \fB--module\fR=\fIMODULE\fR
Also check the symbols found in \fIMODULE\fR.
The default module name is LSB-Core. Other choices are
LSB-Graphics and LSB-C++ (module names are not case-sensitive).
.TP
\fB\-L \fILIB\fR
Specify the full pathname of a library which will be part of the application.
This option can be specified as many times as needed, and will prevent 
.I lsbarchk
from complaining about symbols which are provided in those libraries.
The order of libraries specified this way is significant.
Note that by using -L, you are predicting libraries which will be
specified at link time; if 
.I lsbarchk
is thus convinced not to report on certain issues,
and those libraries are not used at link time,
.IR lsbarchk 's
answers are not very useful!
.TP
\fB\-j \fIJOURNAL\fR, \fB--journal\fR=\fIJOURNAL\fR
Write the journal file to \fIJOURNAL\fR
instead of to the default filename in the current directory.
.PP
A journal file is created named 
.BI journal.archk. libname ,
where 
.I libname
is the library specified on the command line. It contains a record of
the test results in a format that can be submitted for LSB Certification.
You must have write access to the current working directory
in order to run 
.I lsbarchk
successfully, or use the \fB\-j\fR option to
specify an alternate location for the journal.
The journal file can be omitted by the use of the \fB\-n\fP option.
Journal files may be examined with the
.I tjreport
tool, available from the LSB project as part of the
.B lsb-tet3-lite
package.
.SH "NOTES"
.I lsbarchk 
is a predictive tool.  It can identify some problems which are
certain to be issues, but depending on how the final binary is
constructed, may miss others. 
.I lsbappchk
should always be run on the final binary.
.SH "AUTHORS"
The contributors to the Linux Standard Base.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

report bugs at http://bugs.linuxbase.org or email to
<lsb-discuss@linux-foundation.org>.  If you obtained this
from your distribution, report bugs back to the
distribution in the normal way.
