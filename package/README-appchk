LSBAPPCHK
---------

lsbappchk is a program which forms part of a series of checks that a
package is LSB compliant. It verifies that a supplied binary only uses
dynamically linked symbols that are 

a) part of the LSB specification OR
b) in shared libraries in the optionally specified directory (this
   directory and its contents would be packaged with the binary).

Usage: lsbappchk [-L libpath ] file

(for more details, see the manpage)

Note that the version number displayed refers to the version of the
specification that lsbappchk was built for, not the version of
lsbappchk itself.
