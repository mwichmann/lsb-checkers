Local package build for misc-test.  Previously misc-test has been built
from a separate tree (packaging)

Note all four packages will now have the same version (in the past each
carried its own versioning), and they will no longer each have their own
source package, instead lsb-check will be the name of the source package.
We could have renamed the binary packages so they look like subpackages
(lsb-appchk -> lsb-check-app) but there's so much historical - and
current - information that knows the old names so it's easier not to.
