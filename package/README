This is a first cut at a local package build for misc-test.
Previously misc-test has been built from a separate tree.

At this time, we get a full build of the four packages which
are shipped, but after rpm finishes, something goes wrong
and not all of the files are copied in to the package subdir.

To do these as a single specfile, they have to be subpackages,
which leads to name changes - lsb-appchk -> lsb-check-app.
We may not want to do this...  if we do, the replaces/obsoletes
need to be finished off, they're in place but not versioned.

The advantage is we get a single build instead of several
separate ones; and we will get buildbot triggers on commits
without the extra complexity of bringing packaging into play.

Explore: different versions for different subpackages?
or is that a bad idea because now you can't match the one
source package?
