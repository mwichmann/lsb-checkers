lsblibchk
---------

lsblibchk is a program which looks for LSB libraries and checks that
those libraries contain the symbols required by the specification.  If
it is required that the symbol be versioned it checks that the symbol
with the correct version exists in the library. This program can be
used for checking either the runtime LSB environment or the LSB build
environment.
