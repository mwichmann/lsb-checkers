LSBARCHK
--------

lsbarchk is a development tool used to check a static archive for
suitability for use in an LSB-compliant application. Use of non-LSB
interfaces is flagged; the tool can be told about additional libraries
which are to be linked as part of the final link-edit.

Usage: lsbarchk [-L libpath ] file

(for more details, see the manpage)

Each -L argument specifies a path to a library (not a directory).
Note that by using -L, you are predicting libraries which will be
specified at link time; if lsbarchk is convinced not to report on certain
issues as a result, and then the libraries are NOT used at link time,
lsbarchk's answers are not very useful!

The version number displayed refers to the version of the specification
that lsbarchk was built for, not the version of lsbarchk itself.
