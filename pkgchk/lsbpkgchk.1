.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsbpkgchk

.IR modulename "]... ]"
.I pkgname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Measure a package's conformance to the Linux Standard
Base (LSB) specification. The format of the package and the contents of the
payload are checked.  Warnings are produced for anything that is used, but not
contained in the LSB specification.
.TP
\fB\-L \fIlanananame\fR
Specify the LANANA registered name to be used when evaluating pathnames
for FHS conformance.
.TP
\fB\-t
Check the LSB conformance of the executable files in the archive payload
of the package. All shared libraries present in the package are assumed to
be a part of the application, hence lsbpkgchk does not complain about
symbols in executable files which are provided in those shared libraries.
.TP
\fB\-A
Check the symbols found in all modules.
.TP
\fB\-M \fImodulename\fR
Also check the symbols found in module \fImodulename\fR.
The default module name is LSB-Core. Other choices are
LSB-Graphics and LSB-C++ (module names are not case-sensitive).
.PP
A journal file named 
.BI journal.pkgchk. pkgname
is created, where 
.I pkgname
is the package specified on the command line. It contains a record of
the test results in a format that can be submitted for LSB Certification.
You must have write access to the current working directory
in order to run 
.I lsbpkgchk
successfully.
.SH "AUTHORS"
The contributors to the Linux Standard Base.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

from your distribution, report bugs back to the
distribution in the normal way.
.SH "BUGS"
Should be able to specify where to write the journal file.
