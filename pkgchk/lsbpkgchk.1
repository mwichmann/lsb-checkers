.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Measure a package's conformance to the Linux Standard
Base (LSB) specification. The format of the package and the contents of the
payload are checked.  Warnings are produced for anything that is used, but not
contained in the LSB specification.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
Output the program version and LSB version to standard output.
The version and LSB version are always logged to the journal
file irrespective of this option.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB--nojournal\fR
Do not create a journal file.
.TP
\fB\-L \fILANANNAME\fR, \fB--lanana\fR=\fILANANANAME\fR
Specify the LANANA registered package or provider name
to be used when evaluating pathnames for FHS conformance.
.TP
\fB\-t
Check the LSB conformance of the executable files in the archive payload
of the package. All shared libraries present in the package are assumed to
be a part of the application, hence lsbpkgchk does not complain about
symbols in executable files which are provided in those shared libraries.
.TP
\fB\-T \fI[core|desktop]\fR, \fB--lsb-product \fI[core|desktop]\fR
Specify the lsb spec/product to load modules for- 3.0, and 3.1,
respectively.
.TP
\fB\-M \fImodulename\fR
Also check the symbols found in module \fImodulename\fR.
The default module name is LSB-Core. Other choices are
LSB-Graphics and LSB-C++ (module names are not case-sensitive).
.TP
\fB\-j \fIJOURNAL\fR, \fB--journal\fR=\fIJOURNAL\fR
Write the journal file to \fIJOURNAL\fR
instead of to the default filename in the current directory.
.PP
A journal file is created named 
.BI journal.pkgchk. pkgname
where 
.I pkgname
is the package specified on the command line. It contains a record of
the test results in a format that can be submitted for LSB Certification.
You must have write access to the current working directory
in order to run 
.I lsbpkgchk
successfully, or use the \fB\-j\fR option to
specify an alternate location for the journal.
The journal file can be omitted by the use of the \fB\-n\fP option.
Journal files may be examined with the
.I tjreport
tool, available from the LSB project as part of the
.B lsb-tet3-lite
package.
.SH "AUTHORS"
The contributors to the Linux Standard Base.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
If you obtained this checker from the LSB ftp site,
report bugs at http://bugs.linuxbase.org or email to
<lsb-test@freestandards.org>.  If you obtained this
from your distribution, report bugs back to the
distribution in the normal way.
.SH "BUGS"
Should be able to specify where to write the journal file.
