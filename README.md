This is the Linux Standard Base (LSB) checkers code - includes
application checker, library checker, commands checker and more.

GitHub note:
The github repository is a mirror of the master, which lives in bzr at
http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/devel/misc-test/
The github mirror is created for experimental purposes, and is not to
be considered the official version of the code - because it is not
updated automatically, it may be missing important changes. 

Bazaar note:
If you are looking at this file in the bzr repository, just ignore
the github comments!

For notes on the packaging aspects, see the README files in the package
subdirectory.

Note that many of these files (including virtually all of dynchk) are
generated from a moderately complex setup that involves the LSB database,
but except for the rpm specfile, the generated files are committed here.
This note is added because you are not expected to modify by hand these
generated files.
